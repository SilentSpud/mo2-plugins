# Mod Organizer 2 Plugins

## Description

- **Merge Plugins Hide**: Hide / unhide plugins that were merged using `Merge Plugins` or `zMerge`
- **Sync Mod Order**: Sync mod order from current profile to another while keeping the (enabled/disabled) state intact

## Installation

Downlaod [the `.zip` archive](https://github.com/deorder/mo2-plugins/archive/master.zip) and extract it directly into Mod Organizer 2
`plugins/` folder.

The plugin will be added to the `Tools` (icon with puzzle pieces) menu.

## Merge Plugins Hide

**Note:** When using zMerge to merge mods Mator recommends to use zMerge's built-in functionality to disable plugins. If you use this zMerge will disable the plugins for you. If you still want to use `Merge Plugins Hide` for example to keep track of the state of the plugins that are merged and quickly enable/disable them you can also set the `hide-type` to `disable` to use the same method as zMerge uses.

You can choose between the following plugin hide methods by changing the `hide-type` setting:

- **mohidden**: Hide using the MO2 virtual file system by adding `.mohidden` to the plugin file
- **optional**: Hide by moving the plugin file to the `optional` directory inside the mod
- **disable**: Hide by disabling the plugin
